Hi! John here. I write games and backends in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). Other projects include nix tooling and the occasional hardware development. Some traits of mine:
- I've been known to re-invent the wheel periodically.
- I'm a pathological [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) evangelist.
- I like walking; a lot.
